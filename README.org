WS6Z's Simplex Mapping System

* Creating the initial database

  To create the initial database, which is stored in an SQLite file,
  run the createdb script:

    ./createdb -d mydb -u WS6Z -g mygroup -p sharedpassword -P myadminpassword

  This will create the 'mydb' file and populate it with the minimal
  required data: a single user (WS6Z) and a single group (mygroup)
  with both a shared password and a administrative password for the
  group.  Obviously you should change the passwords to something
  specific to you.  And it's unlikely you'll want to use my callsign :-)
